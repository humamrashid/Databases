My database backup program is a bash script that is run every day at 1:00 AM
using cron on UNIX-like systems (tested on Ubuntu 19.10). Explanation for use is
in the script comments. (The password for database owner is of course not the
real one).

Bash Script

#!/bin/bash
# Humam Rashid
# CISC 7510X, Fall 2019.

# psqldb_backup: a script for UNIX-like systems running bash to archive and
# encrypt Postgresql database tables. Only works with psql and GnuPG. Further,
# the script assumes GnuPG has been configured and a key pair already generated.

# Works on one database at a time but any number of tables from the database can
# be supplied as arguments. First 5 arguments to the script are database owner
# password, database owner name, database name, backup path and recipient
# user-id (i.e., email address), respectively. Any arguments thereafter are
# considered to be the names of tables from the database. Each encrypted archive
# for a particular table is saved in the backup directory with the original name
# followed by a timestamp and ending '.tar.gz.gpg'.

if [ $# -lt 6 ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 <db_pass> <db_owner> <db_name> <backup_path> <recipient>"\
        "<tab1...tabN>"
    exit 1
fi
if [ ! -d $4 ]; then
    echo "directory $4 does not exist!"
    exit 2
fi
cd $4
for ((i=0; i<=$#; i++)); do
    if [ $i -gt 5 ]; then
        PGPASSWORD=$1 psql -U $2 -d $3 -c \
        "\copy ${!i} to stdout with (format csv, header true, delimiter ',');" \
        > ${!i}.csv && \
        tar cz ${!i}.csv | gpg --encrypt --recipient $5 \
        > ${!i}.$(date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S').tar.gz.gpg && \
        rm ${!i}.csv
    fi
done
