Inventory System for Automobile Junkyard
----------------------------------------

In attempting to design the inventory system, I wasn't sure if the requirements
were limited to search data only (i.e., data on the available parts only) or the
entire process of searching, buying, etc. I assumed to be safe that more or less
the entire process is required based on my understanding of how typical
inventory systems (e.g., online bookstores) work. Due to this, my desgin is an
amalgamation of the online store DB design discussed in class along with
management requirements for junkyard parts.

The following is the schema for the transactions part of the inventory system
based directly on the design discussed in class, fitted for the
junkyard-specific terminology. (Both sets of schema are interlinked and part of
the same desgin, I'm just separating what I pilfered from class notes and what
I came up with myself).

customer()
purchase()
purchase_detail()
price_history()

The table 'products' is left out above since products in the junkyard are of a
specific variety and mentioned separately with the search/management part of the
inventory system.
