Inventory System for Automobile Junkyard
----------------------------------------

In attempting to design the inventory system, I wasn't sure if the requirements
were limited to search data only (i.e., data on the available parts only) or the
entire process of searching, buying, etc. To be safe, I assumed that more or
less the entire process is required based on my understanding of how typical
inventory systems (e.g., online bookstores) work. Due to this, my design is an
amalgamation of the online store DB design discussed in class along with
management requirements for junkyard automobile parts. The schema are divided
into sections for ease of reading but its meant to be all in one database.

The following is the schema for the transactions section of section inventory
system and is based directly on the design discussed in class, adjusted for the
junkyard-specific use case:

Transactions
------------
create table customer(
    customerid bigint,
    name       varchar(100),
    address    varchar(100),
    phone1     varchar(20),
    phone2     varchar(20),
    email      varchar(100)
);
create table purchase(
    purchaseid bigint,
    customerid bigint,
    ptime      timestamp
);
create table purchase_detail(
    purchaseid bigint,
    partid,    bigint,
    quantity   bigint
);
create table price_history(
    partid bigint,
    price  numeric(8,2),
    prtime timestamp
);

The purposes of the above tables were discussed at length in class so I am not
repeating them here. The table 'products' is left out above in contrast to the
class notes and instead replaced with 'parts' since products in the junkyard are
of a specific variety. It is mentioned separately with the search & inventory
management section of the system. 

The following is the schema for the inventory tracking and search facilities of
a junkyard business:

Search & Inventory Management
-----------------------------
create table automobile(
    autoid bigint,
    color  varchar(100),
    model  varchar(100),
    make   varchar(100),
    body   varchar(100),
    year   bigint
);
create table parts(
     autoid    bigint,
     partid    bigint,
     modid     bigint,
     partdesc  varchar(500),
     partprice numeric(8,2),
     quantity  bigint
);
create table compatible(
    partid bigint,
    autoid bigint,
    moded  boolean
);
create table location(
    localeid bigint,
    partid   bigint,
    street   varchar(20),
    city     varchar(20),
    county   varchar(20),
    postal   varchar(10),
    country  varchar(20),
    phone    varchar(20),
    email    varchar(100),
    link     varchar(100)
);

The following is the schema of a limited set of services/processing work that
might be performed in a typical junkyard:

Services & Processing Management
--------------------------------
create table modification(
    modid    bigint,
    partid   bigint,
    original varchar(100),
    current  varchar(100)
);
create table mod_history(
    partid  bigint,
    moddesc varchar(500),
    mtime   timestamp
);
create table waiting_list(
    customerid bigint,
    partid     bigint,
    quantity   bigint
);
create table delivery(
    deilveryid bigint,
    purchaseid bigint,
    localeid   bigint,
    dtime      timestamp
);

# EOF.
